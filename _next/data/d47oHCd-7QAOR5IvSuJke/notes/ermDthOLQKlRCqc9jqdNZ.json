When the parent/caregiver is tired or needs to do something  they can use the TV.\nChildren below the age of 3 years are not likely to learn anything from TV. Older children (3-5) can get value from educational material, such as Sesame Street.

Perhaps the best causal evidence on this question\ncomes from a 2008 paper by two media economists.1 The researchers take advantage\nof the fact that television was introduced to different areas of the United States at\ndifferent times. This variation meant that, when television was first introduced in the\n1940s and 1950s, some kids had access to TV when they were children and\nsome did not. The researchers could then see how having TV access as a\nyoung child — what the AAP is most worried about — related to test scores\nwhen kids were in school at slightly older ages.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>maybe small impact on obesity, but difficult to study</li>\n<li>What do you do instead of TV/ gaming. if whining and doing nothing, not so good.

The process of weight gain and loss is pretty simple: if you burn more calories than you take in, you’ll lose weight. Watching television is mostly done sitting. And most other activities involve at least some moving around. So pretty much no matter what else they do, watching less TV is likely to be associated with kids burning more calories and losing weight.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"/PublicPersonalKnowledgeBase/notes/pohXgII67dAxnoufG7yAP\">Child Development</a></p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/PublicPersonalKnowledgeBase/notes/pohXgII67dAxnoufG7yAP\">Child Development</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","title":"Root","desc":"","updated":1647507231129,"created":1631901573363,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"db285659ccac8b133c384de1ef51de66","links":[],"anchors":{"welcome-to-stefans-notes":{"type":"header","text":"Welcome to Stefan's Notes!","value":"welcome-to-stefans-notes","line":7,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["mxzxxu8z4e6krz99ht96y9d","W1EOZ27Tqx6RbiA2aW3DI","DyoLE2kwm9rRfRZhBGxPW","idhfogizmtcmvaamtalp3o3","4w8wBCSRvYUnGIZeozW03","vB321AipYCs6ldVC0APs9","h6WVdl1UTWVXeWuMJSZ1f","bth6m0exy9q9loxib1mc4al","4abAmH56ausbldEJbZokx","JyOFJ5NTPSVWMfiDy951X","0OO7fjCpcaGZg5qDRZr8z","138666663","pohXgII67dAxnoufG7yAP","6hs48bnjnaoxahk07exj74u","42r6290iqzLPmg9BY7fIp","3hoLerNJHjNkDziIKlFF2","T6meT3UNw0nRorEbzoPSl","hIOTXIIBj3vmhG1xc91lA","tnFlQuOAGPkbU2fZI7Cb1","Jb3w3f4x8kixLhrjUW6S1","LV6q5jlD2xtCF6yYFEqFC","ENDcCZFjAW9h66eDoFg7I","b5IeREnsTbeggC7rmWV0p","2hmbhdzcdljtdwln762gcrv","z9la6u9t3xueldj2omf2gc6","9akeo93l6b026jmu4t6e7pw","sc24o4jglr9jg29qr5v0e44","0mt5ao8tbbz3z5mdwe0aer8","r7rvb6nal69nfb6ogqdadnm","xujx5iuxskj10o0ajpi109n","lyl1rzqz6zwcswpwh0kafrm","skpw697vlqdq3t3uqxpq5e3","a4tts3oc3oms7wuralrbzdc","13a1ufqh6o8yi9evw1u5kv5"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"# Welcome to Stefan's Notes!\n\n        \n\nLast updated: 2021.12.30\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"dendronVersion":"0.95.0","enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"templateHierarchy":"template"},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"Personal knowledge space"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","assetsPrefix":"/PublicPersonalKnowledgeBase","siteUrl":"https://petrovs12.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"theme":"light","templateVersion":"0.97.0","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
