Choose fish, crustaceans, and mollusks with a high omega-3, omega-6, and vitamin B12 content (salmon, anchovies, sardines, cod, sea bream, trout, clams, shrimp.  Pay attention to the quality of the fish, choosing those with low levels of mercury.</li>\n<li>If you are below the age of 65, keep protein intake low (0.31 to 0.36 grams per pound of body weight). That comes to 40 to 47 grams of proteins per day for a person weighing 130 pounds, and 60 to 70 grams of protein per day for someone weighing 200 to 220 pounds. Over age 65, you should slightly increase protein intake but also increase consumption of fish, eggs, white meat, and products derived from goats and sheep to preserve muscle mass. Consume beans, chickpeas, green peas, and other legumes as your main source of protein.</li>\n<li>Minimize saturated fats from animal and vegetable sources (meat, cheese) and sugar, and maximize good fats and complex carbs. Eat whole grains and high quantities of vegetables (tomatoes, broccoli, carrots, legumes, etc.) with generous amounts of olive oil (3 tablespoons per day) and nuts (1 ounce per day).</li>\n<li>Follow a diet with high vitamin and mineral content, supplemented with a multivitamin buffer every three days.</li>\n<li>Select ingredients among those discussed in this book that your ancestors would have eaten.</li>\n<li>Based on your weight, age, and abdominal circumference, decide whether to have two or three meals per day. If you are overweight or tend to gain weight easily, consume two meals a day: breakfast and either lunch or dinner, plus two low-sugar (less than 5 grams) snacks with fewer than 100 calories each. If you are already at a normal weight, or if you tend to lose weight easily or are over 65 and of normal weight, eat three meals a day and one low-sugar (less than 3 to 5 grams) snack with fewer than 100 calories.</li>\n<li>Confine all eating to within a twelve-hour period; for example, start after 8 a.m. and end before 8 p.m. Don’t eat anything within three to four hours of bedtime.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"rhonda-patrick\">Rhonda Patrick<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#rhonda-patrick\"></a></h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foundmyfitness.com/about-dr-rhonda-patrick\">Podcast By Rhonda Patrick</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"finnish-sauna-study\">Finnish Sauna Study<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#finnish-sauna-study\"></a></h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/sauna-use-linked-longer-life-fewer-fatal-heart-problems-201502257755\">From Harvard Health</a></p>\n<p>Researchers from the University of Eastern Finland tracked 2,300 middle-aged men for an average of 20 years. They categorized the men into three groups according to how often they used a sauna each week. The men spent an average of 14 minutes per visit baking in 175° F heat. Over the course of the study, <strong>49% of men who went to a sauna once a week died, compared with 38% of those who went two to three times a week and just 31% of those who went four to seven times a week</strong>.
