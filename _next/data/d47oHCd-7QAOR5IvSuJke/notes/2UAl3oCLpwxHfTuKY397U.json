Also get some special <a href=\"https://www.thebump.com/a/best-baby-detergent\"> baby laundry detergent</a> and wash new everything new before wearing. Idk if needed, but my partner did it.</p>\n<ol start=\"0\">\n<li>Baby stroller- not much opinion, you can buy used, just test it, look so it has big wheels as it's easier to handle. Also if you're driving, be careful if buying so it's easy to put a base on the car. I think there are different standards and so on. For us we put it without the base.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Bed - We used <a href=\"https://www.happiestbaby.com/products/snoo-smart-bassinet\">Snoo Smart Sleeper</a> . By far the best item on the list if you can get it, highly recommended. Will send some sleeping data separately.\n<a href=\"https://www.littlebabygear.com/cheaper-snoo-alternative/\">You can also look at this article</a>.\nAlso consider buying some <a href=\"https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B08DG66XWC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s02?ie=UTF8&#x26;psc=1\">baby swaddles</a>. We bought some, but practically used only the ones w/ the snoo. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Books - we read very little, but I do recommend <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.jp/s?k=emily+oster&#x26;crid=6IVPRSTBTOZC&#x26;sprefix=emily+oster%2Caps%2C259&#x26;ref=nb_sb_noss_1\">Emily Oster's books</a>.\nWe are using a lot of the advice there. It appeals to me cause it's short and it has a lot of meta-analyses of papers and help you ease your anxiety specifically about breastfeeding and so. She now has a <a href=\"https://emilyoster.substack.com/\">blog, which is pretty nice too</a>.\nI went trough first 5 chapters of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Ari-Brown/dp/1889392618/ref=sr_1_1?crid=7LR0P02PBXVG&#x26;keywords=baby+411&#x26;qid=1643489049&#x26;sprefix=baby+411%2Caps%2C100&#x26;sr=8-1\">Baby 411</a>, it's great, then used rest for reference</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/SoundSpa-Shower-Sleeping-Adjustable-Stroller/dp/B07317NQKW/ref=sr_1_11?crid=E17IESH6MEN3&#x26;keywords=baby+white+noise+machine&#x26;qid=1643488800&#x26;sprefix=baby+white+noise+machin%2Caps%2C246&#x26;sr=8-11\">Dedicated white noise machine</a> is a great one.0ww</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<p>In-ear or contactless thermomether.
