Thus they feel like\nthe strategy is bad.</p>\n<p>But this interpretation could be wrong, as the greater effort could be related to growth.</p>\n<p>Similar to <a href=\"/PublicPersonalKnowledgeBase/notes/hk78xufelqjpu33lvij793g\">Progressive Overload</a>. What's the difference, since everyone likes progressive overload? <strong>Measurement is noisy and not instant, maybe?</strong></p>\n<p>So if it feels hard, people think they suck at it. If it feels easy, they think they are good at it. But this is clearly wrong</p>\n<p>Effort avoidance hypothesis.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/PublicPersonalKnowledgeBase/notes/aryfgxk52mayz0mt1jf96b7\">Cognitive Biases</a></p>\n<pre><code>Across these first three studies, a consistent pattern emerged: The more learners perceived a study strategy as mentally effortful,\nthe less they judged it to be effective for learning; this, in turn, predicted their choice of study strategies such that the more effective\nthat participants thought a strategy was for learning, the more likely they were to choose it for future study. That is, we observed an\nindirect effect of perceived effort on study strategy choices, mediated by perceived learning. This pattern held across differences in\nstudy strategies (the choice between blocked vs. interleaved schedules and the choice between restudy vs. retrieval practice), to-belearned materials (learning to classify category exemplars and learning of science texts), subject populations (students and the\ngeneral adult population), and locations (the Web or a laboratory). This indirect effect also always held across both participants’\nmeasures of immediate perceptions of each strategy and retrospective comparisons of the two strategies. It also held even when\ncontrolling for participants’ objective performance during study.\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"/PublicPersonalKnowledgeBase/assets/images/2022-08-06-12-52-28.png\"></p>\n<p>So basically it's supported, though in the previous paragraph it feels like it isn't...</p>\n<p>Probably how to think about how the analysis works exactly...s</p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/PublicPersonalKnowledgeBase/notes/84toe2l372vlttydmfdd55g\">Course Notes</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","title":"Root","desc":"","updated":1647507231129,"created":1631901573363,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"db285659ccac8b133c384de1ef51de66","links":[],"anchors":{"welcome-to-stefans-notes":{"type":"header","text":"Welcome to Stefan's Notes!","value":"welcome-to-stefans-notes","line":7,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["mxzxxu8z4e6krz99ht96y9d","W1EOZ27Tqx6RbiA2aW3DI","DyoLE2kwm9rRfRZhBGxPW","idhfogizmtcmvaamtalp3o3","4w8wBCSRvYUnGIZeozW03","vB321AipYCs6ldVC0APs9","h6WVdl1UTWVXeWuMJSZ1f","bth6m0exy9q9loxib1mc4al","4abAmH56ausbldEJbZokx","JyOFJ5NTPSVWMfiDy951X","0OO7fjCpcaGZg5qDRZr8z","138666663","pohXgII67dAxnoufG7yAP","6hs48bnjnaoxahk07exj74u","42r6290iqzLPmg9BY7fIp","3hoLerNJHjNkDziIKlFF2","T6meT3UNw0nRorEbzoPSl","hIOTXIIBj3vmhG1xc91lA","tnFlQuOAGPkbU2fZI7Cb1","Jb3w3f4x8kixLhrjUW6S1","LV6q5jlD2xtCF6yYFEqFC","ENDcCZFjAW9h66eDoFg7I","b5IeREnsTbeggC7rmWV0p","2hmbhdzcdljtdwln762gcrv","z9la6u9t3xueldj2omf2gc6","9akeo93l6b026jmu4t6e7pw","sc24o4jglr9jg29qr5v0e44","0mt5ao8tbbz3z5mdwe0aer8","r7rvb6nal69nfb6ogqdadnm","xujx5iuxskj10o0ajpi109n","lyl1rzqz6zwcswpwh0kafrm","skpw697vlqdq3t3uqxpq5e3","a4tts3oc3oms7wuralrbzdc","13a1ufqh6o8yi9evw1u5kv5"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"# Welcome to Stefan's Notes!\n\n        \n\nLast updated: 2021.12.30\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"dendronVersion":"0.95.0","enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"templateHierarchy":"template"},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"Personal knowledge space"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","assetsPrefix":"/PublicPersonalKnowledgeBase","siteUrl":"https://petrovs12.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"theme":"light","templateVersion":"0.97.0","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
