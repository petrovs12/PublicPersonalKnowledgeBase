<ul>
<li>
<p>00:30 - Have your study stuff with you</p>
<p><strong>Optimize Environment, make it you don't get up. All resources in front.</strong>
Foods for study- almonds/fruit (no sugar crash).

<li>
<p>05:13 - Recommended snacks + explanation on notetaking</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of study happens inside the head.
Spend as little time of notetaking as possible.
Once done the learning, document that.</p>
<p><strong>Thinking a lot, playing with ideas</strong>, less time spent on notetaking (?).</p>
<p>Always handwritten, always non-written if possible (?).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>06:23 - More explanation on notetaking and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>07:52 - Handwritten notes vs typed notes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>09:41 - Priming Step
<a href="/PublicPersonalKnowledgeBase/notes/wlclce0s020vvgiayqembzu">Priming</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>12:10 - Sensory Distraction or Sensory Deprivation
Keep your focus on reading, maybe rythim. Play pen/etc. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>13:25 - What he is reading atm for priming
When you read a sentence during priming, even if you don't know the words, play with it, think what it could mean,etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>14:03 - Learning in your head is slow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>16:52 - Finished reading contents + how to avoid passive reading + concentration tip + explanation on what he's thinking
<strong>Be clear on why you're reading something. Both in terms of the inidial goal, and where he's at at a given timepoint</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>19:10 - Explanation on reading the preface (speed reading)
<strong>Preface is skimmed.</strong> Skim trough about what that's talking about... It's okay to skip if you don't need to learn it ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>21:21 - Quick note on the mental model
Mental model - no words, but images. Turn words into images. Re-express it as a mental image... Image is easier to hold than 10 different words across a flowchart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>22:53 - How he developed this method
<strong>1000s of hours of reading research, 10000s of hours of self-experimentation</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>23:34 - Drawing out what he is imagining
So the point is just to try to right away connect stuff, enrich the image and as you go correct it if needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>25:30 - Embracing the confusion</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Go back and forth with things.</strong>
<a href="/PublicPersonalKnowledgeBase/notes/hk78xufelqjpu33lvij793g">Progressive Overload</a></p>
<p>Try to keep as many things in your mind as long as comfortable, then keep in mind a bit longer <a href="/PublicPersonalKnowledgeBase/notes/hk78xufelqjpu33lvij793g">Progressive Overload</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>28:37 - Page 1 + Priming + If I don't remember something, how do I overcome it
So it's quite different than the second brain stuff in many ways...</li>
<li>31:21 - Priming through the pages
he thinks that his initial framework was accurate. Having a visual aid might be good.</li>
<li>33:57 - Finished priming</li>
<li>35:04 - Do you listen to study music?
maybe/probably not...</li>
<li>35:55 - Going through from the beginning being curious and inquisitive (why am I reading this, for what purpose, how can I apply it and how can I simplify it) - Blooms Taxonomy</li>
<li>37:42 - Are you reading backwards?</li>
<li>38:40 - A relaxing process; a well-oiled habit
Go back and forth with the things you're reading. Be quite active with it in your mind. If using kindle or something,
figure out how to quickly go back and forth w/ the reading...</li>
<li>41:00 - How can I apply it?
<strong>Always think "how would I apply this"?  Why is this useful to create other stuff...</strong></li>
<li>42:40 - Loosing any detail when skimming
Losing detail is fine. Don't care.</li>
<li>46:06 - Annotating while reading - is it valid?</li>
<li>47:32 - Is this the only study technique that you use?</li>
<li>49:24 - Bullet Points - Memorizing specifics</li>
<li>53:01 - Change on his mental model (Hypercorrection effect)</li>
<li>54:11 - Read his mind + course ad + guarantee</li>
<li>59:04 - Threshhold concept breached - "Lightbulb moment"</li>
<li>1:04:05 - The best time to take breaks</li>
<li>1:05:29 - He's confused - Apply+Simplify</li>
<li>1:06:09 - Trying to make an analogy to simplify</li>
<li>1:10:44 - Creating focus</li>
<li>1:15:15 - Remembers another framework thus speeding up the process of learning</li>
<li>1:16:53 - Skips to another part of the book to learn more about a topic</li>
<li>1:18:16 - Back to where he was</li>
<li>1:23:48 - Study sessions vary</li>
<li>1:26:42 - Exponential increase + special information + good book</li>
<li>1:30:35 - Hour and a half of stream (40min study - page 33)</li>
<li>1:31:04 - Notes after priming? prioritize learning istead of note taking + showing mindmap</li>
<li>1:35:40 - Reading details and it makes sense because he knows the logic behind all of it</li>
<li>1:38:55 - Satisfaction of learning</li>
<li>1:44:54 - Quick technique - analogy and representing on the mindmap</li>
<li>1:46:42 - Are there any more websites to find out more about learning? + thoughts on study tips and non scientifical sources</li>
<li>1:49:13 - Thomas Frank
1:53:41 - 50 pages + What do you mean by studying fast? + What is a successful study session? + ending</li>

<p>Talkign about Interleaveing...</p>
<p>Declarative vs Procedural...</p>
<p>Spacing and Interleaving effects.
Research on Interleaving is quite large.</p>

<p>Orders of learning:</p>
<ol>
<li>repeat</li>
<li>understand and can apply basics to familiar concept, and remember.
This is kind of isolated...</li>
<li>Can Apply</li>
<li>Can apply to varying contexts, how it relates to other things
...</li>
<li>Can produce new things.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Higher order learning - learn how to use the concept in a highly creative concept...</p>
<p>Interleaving 'Table'</p>
<p>Best things to do are: </p>
<p>for declarative:</p>
<p>Brain dump, generated isolated questions, isolated teaching, , teachingw/ relations, chunkmaps, peer/groupd discussion.</p>
<p><strong>So basically studying with people is the best...*</strong></p>
<h1 id="good-techniques">Good Techniques<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#good-techniques"></a></h1>
<p>3C- cover-copy, check - ow level</p>
<p>Practice questions- extended method. - solve a problem sheet, then for everything you're unsure, re-solve while looking at the material. Then compare answers vs original answers and book answers...</p>
<p>REBIM -(Repetitive execution Beyond Initial Mastery).</p>
<p>Brain Dump (MindMap) - just make a mind map/excalidraw of everything you know...</p>
<p>Generated Questions (Isolated, Broad).</p>
<p>Teaching (Isolated, simple relational)...</p>

<p>There are four key steps to the Feynman Technique:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a concept you want to learn about</li>
<li>Explain it to a 12 year old</li>
<li>Reflect, Refine, and Simplify</li>
<li>Organize and Review</li>
</ol>
<p>Creating an answer sheet by itself can consolidate learning...</p>
<p>Retrieved execution (applied).</p>
<p>Challenges with the topic...</p>
<p>Later mastery levels basically is 'How to be a good researcher...'a</p>
<p>Solution -
while reading some tutorials, add some variation, but on the variables of interest.</p>
