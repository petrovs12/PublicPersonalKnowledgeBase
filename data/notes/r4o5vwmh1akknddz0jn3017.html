<p>Current Demographic problems of China.</p>
<p>Movement of Age Pyramid.</p>
<p>History of industrialization, cost of living, number of children, and cultural transition.</p>
<p>USA transitioned to industrializaiton over 7 (?) generations. This made it easier to figure out how to raise children in industrializing age.</p>
<p>China started in 1970s. </p>
<p>In the village, children are free labor.
In the city, headache.</p>
<p>20-30s mid-low added value work+ consumption
40-50s high added value work + investment
60s+ capital gains
After- retirement- no economic impact.</p>
<p>median china age

<p>very bad now...</p>
<p>Cold war:</p>
<p>US protects international trade (sea), in exchange writes everyone's security policy. </p>
<p>For US- security, for rest-economic deal.</p>
<p>Now- US navy unsuited to protect international trade, suited for wars and power projection.</p>
<p>Too many battleships, too few destroyer ships.</p>
<p>End of the undettered globalization.</p>
<p>China bad politics+ bad demographics.</p>
<p>China- high dependency of raw material inputs.</p>
<p>Russia- lots of oil, natural gas, fertilizers, paladium, lithium.
Green revolution also doesn't work without Russia.</p>
<p>Wind and solar- don't work so well, batteries are a problem.
Not enough lithium in the world, maybe better battery technology.</p>
<p>Germany- stupidly still not embracing nuclear power.
Raw materials and such</p>
<p>Germany in trouble, but connected.</p>
<p>Will Ukraine blow up pipes? Maybe:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes, if they dont' want Russia to get funded.</li>
<li>No, cause they're now a Candidate member of EU and EU is going to rebuild them, so they have interest EU doesn't suffer and can function => has energy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Putin maybe had to just invade Donbas + Land Bridge and would've been fine ?</p>
<p>Biden -putin meeting before that - mainly about hacker attacks on colonial pipe.</p>
<p>If China/industrial base of world- mass retirement.</p>
<p>But china very innovative, might be quite advanced in technology. This might offset some of the problems.
They are <strong>more innovative and entrepreneural than anyone but USA</strong>.</p>
<p>Germany- energy problems, can't keep lights on, 3rd industrial base in the world.</p>
<p>American political system.</p>
<p><a href="/PublicPersonalKnowledgeBase/notes/xn3xzb9emkcp5fg3nk39kq9#^firstpost">Voting</a></p>
<p>Factions within the 2 parties. </p>
<p>Re-alignment process within the parties, what are the key questions that determine if Republican or Democrat.</p>
<p>Process takes time and is not painless.</p>
<p>Everyone wants their issue to be the one that determines if you're Republican or Democrat.</p>
<p>Union movement is now Republican...</p>
<p>Oil/natural gas maybe quite inelastic (<a href="/PublicPersonalKnowledgeBase/notes/0u5qyti2a40a5b4m7p1ptbg">Price Elasticity</a>)- if supply drops by 5-8%, price double.</p>
<p>US needs to double industrial base.
Maybe high growth+high inflation in US.</p>
<p>China- leader on climate, new tech...</p>
<p>Maybe 1.5-2 deg, rather than 3-6 before hitting net 0.
<a href="/PublicPersonalKnowledgeBase/notes/k0jdh5cq8frtw1qvg68h2s9">Climate Change and Global Warming</a></p>
<p>Chinese geography not great for wind/solar.
Germany good for wind. But doesn't seem to work. Only generates 9% of actual electricity, >2 trillion of investment.
US good for wind+solar.
UK good for wind+solar.
Spain good for solar
Greece good for solar+wind.</p>
<p>Nuclear. Germans not willing to embrace Nuclear as part of the long-term solution.</p>
<p>Phisical chemistry - batteries.</p>
