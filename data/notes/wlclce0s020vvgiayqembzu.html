<p>Ways to read a paper first pass</p>
<p>Video by sung- build skeleton first;
etc.
So go quickly trough the table of contents and try to gleam what the topic is and what are it's subtopics.</p>
<p>Useful for math ? Maybe not</p>
<p><strong>Main headings, start, end of paragraph, figures.</strong></p>
<p>How many concepts, what are the concepts, how dense.</p>
<p>Read ToC first.</p>
<p><strong>Try to ask deep questions as you go, even if you don't know the wods. Try to guess possible answers/ideas.</strong></p>
<p>Focus on the conceptual understanding, ignoring the stuff that makes no sense.</p>
<p>Go back and forth between pages.</p>
<p>As long as you feel like you're learning, should feel pretty happy with that by itself.</p>
<p>Go trough the pages briefly to finish the priming...</p>
<p>Doesn't really work with math (?)</p>
