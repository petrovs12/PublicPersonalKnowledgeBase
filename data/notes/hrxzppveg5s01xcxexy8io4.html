<p>deceptiveness and ai</p>
<p>training 'against' deception wont work
say it's against 'overtly deceptive' things, or even if some introspection techniques work,
the 'i'will deceive now' thought pattern.</p>
<p>So, not only deceptive output, but also precursors.</p>
<p>We show how generically useful thought patterns that are not deceptive by themselves
when combined can produce deceptive output.</p>
<p>imagine if the thought matches a predicate, it's marked as deceptive
<a href="/PublicPersonalKnowledgeBase/notes/s1mryy134ktp8mo791j0db8">Predicates</a>.</p>
<p>say the ai is a bit anthropomorphic, and it can spawn threads of thought
we name appropriately ('planning thread', monitoring thread, threads for different subtasks),
and it also has ....</p>
<p>conclsion picture:</p>
<p>ai as a problem solver can develop a 'abstractize the problem in a way that deception is not in the model',
solve it, invert the solution in steps that don't refer to deception...</p>
<p>example - sends instructions to a human-controlled wet lab to execute, blah blah biological goal, delays in the lab if instructions too long, ai notices a pattern, tries several things, where it notices threads get terminated for no apparent reason (every time the 'deceive' predicate) is matched, eventually represents everything as some kind of search in a graph or a vehicle routing or a markov decision process that doesn't
refer to the humans and thus doesn't involve deception, it's not terminated, the inverted sequence of steps doesn't refer to deception.</p>
<p>Bonus:</p>
<p>How it also can notice it's forbidden to think about the specific predicate and thart 'thinkingabout that...'</p>
