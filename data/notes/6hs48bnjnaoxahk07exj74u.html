<p>-- Make a mock service in python, connect it to a mock web internal tool.
-- [Pytorch/BM/pyro] - make a logistic regression, as well as a mixed linear model in BM...
-- try to write a process in pyro/bm
-- [Communicate the status of the OR experiment to Sergei/etc]
-- Check with bento ppl when CC is available in hack/JS...
-- [learn what is a scaled lift experiment]
-- Write down a simulation about what is 'scaled lyft' --
