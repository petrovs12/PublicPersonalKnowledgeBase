Your computer <strong>keyboard has a processor</strong> inside of it, similar to the one inside your computer. This processor <strong>runs software</strong> that is responsible for <strong>detecting button pr
sesses</strong> and informing the computer when keys are pressed. <strong>QMK Firmware</strong> fills the role of <strong>that software</strong>, detecting button presses and passing that information on to the host computer. When you build your <strong>custom keymap</strong>, you are creating an <strong>executable program for your keyboard</strong>.

<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, fork the ergohaven's fork of the qMk repo. they have the code there.</li>
<li>Make sure the compiler works, using some of the example keyboards in the qmk repo.</li>
<li>install the qmk. it was tricky to do on linux, as there was something with the nmPy first, and then after that arm stack etc...</li>
<li>From the EH repo, copy to the vial repo, the EH files. Edit as needed. I basically removed the fancy rgb sruff, and added rhe tap daace stuff. </li>
<li>Build the files. I found the build hex files in rhe .build folder in the repo.</li>
<li>Use the qmk toolbox to flash. The best way to flash is to check in <strong>Vial</strong> where is the <strong>Reset</strong> button. This will put the kb in the flash mode, then relAtively quickly press the <strong> flash</strong> button in the qmk toolbox interface. </li>
<li>Of course, there is an equivalent command line way to do that, but haven't used it.</li>
<li>Voila, you gotthe tap dace option now!!!</li>

<p>On windows there is autohotkey, which has a bunch of advanced functionalities.
On unix and mac (as well as Win), there is  kmonad, which can I suppose emulate qmk pretty well...</p>
<p>Will try to check it out, p;erhaps especially with autoshift for the kinesis and so on...</p>
<p>Maybe also on the lapop i would be nice.</p>
