<li>How our brain processes film and music
Language is low-bandwidth. For example,I say 'this film made me sad and  angry'. You're not going to necessarily understand what 'angry' means in this context. In reality, a film or book evokes a multitude of thoughts, which are complicated and hard to convey in low-bandwidth media, such as language. If I have a Neuralink connection with you, I can directly give you the bucket of thoughts and feelings that I'm feeling.
<strong>Stefan's commentary</strong> - it's debatable if this makes sense, as you still have the summarization problem.
That is, why would the bucket then be more concise of just the person watching the movie?</li>
