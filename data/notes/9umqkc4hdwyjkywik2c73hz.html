<p>LangChain allows to chain models into different things, giving programmability..</p>
<p>Basic example- one component decides what language you're speaking, then the next models are the ones you call..</p>
<p>Some python funcitons to extract structured data from your models...</p>
<p>There can be agents that are being called into one another, performing various functions, talking to each other...</p>
<p>Vector db's and embeddings....</p>
<p>built image-to-text using blip...</p>
