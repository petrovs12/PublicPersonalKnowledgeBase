<p>OAuth allows an app to use the API of a platform (say Twitter) on your behalf without ever seeing your Twitter password.</p>

<p>Markets have intermediaries, who connect buyers and sellers by knowing what both want and create convenient ways to transact.
Apps are the new intermediaries.</p>

<p>API's require trust. Innovation require openness. Trust and openness are at odds.</p>
<p>An innovative app could want to use your Twitter/Facebook/Google/etc data for a specific purpose.
It uses that by calling some API's Twitter/Facebook/Google provide.</p>
<p>But, you can't trust the app with your google password, as you have everything in there. If the password leaks, you're boned</p>
<p>OAuth is a way to get around this. </p>

<p>A vallet key for a car is a <strong>limited privilige key</strong> you can use to operate the car, but not access the car's glove box or trunc.</p>
<p> OAuth tries to simulate this by having it's own <strong>vallet key: token</strong> giving a single app/API access to particular API's/services on a <strong>service provider (e.g. Twitter)</strong> on behalf of the user .</p>

<h1 id="flow-miko-stefapp-and-twitter">Flow: Miko, stefApp, and Twitter<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#flow-miko-stefapp-and-twitter"></a></h1>
<ol>
<li>Miko uses stefApp on phone, which uses Twitter API for something.Miko already has logins for
stefApp and twitter.</li>
<li>Behind the scenes, stefApp starts the process of getting access from Twitter.</li>
<li>A browser opens, asking Miko to log into with twitter.</li>
<li>A page apprears, asking if Miko gives permission to stefApp to do specific things
and not do other things w/ Miko's Twitter account.</li>
<li>If Miko agrees, then a token is sent back and stored on Miko's phone.</li>
</ol>
<p>This can be sharded to make it harder for a thief to get access to your Twitter account.
stefApp never sees Miko's password.</p>
<p>Key/token permissions cna be gracefully upgraded/downgraded/ stopped if needed.</p>
