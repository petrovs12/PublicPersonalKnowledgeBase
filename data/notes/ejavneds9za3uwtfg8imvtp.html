<p>extrusion, like a hot glue gun, layer by layer, like a building, needs supports</p>

<p>turns a 3d model file into executable instructions for the printer, mostly gcode, most of which containst instructions for moving the print head, extruding plastic, and turning the bed on and off.</p>

<p>poLyactyc acid
180-220C printing temp
doestn smell too bad
doesnt require very hot bed</p>
<h3 id="abs">ABS<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#abs"></a></h3>
<p>stinier, more toxic, requires a heated bed, higher printin temperature, main advantage is temperature resistance, and i think uv resistance, also some chemical resistance</p>

<p>look at these, sorted by budget and types:</p>
<p>bambulab p1s, qidi 3x pro, creality k1c</p>
<p>pcoming core xy from twotrees,

promises more than the other </p>
<p>sovol 6 or 7, or anycubic cobra 2 pro or max</p>
<h3 id="core-xy">core xy<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#core-xy"></a></h3>
<p>there are mainly s types of constructions i know of, which are about what parts move how and how the construction is done. atm corexy is the hotness, as there the bed moves only up and down, which makes you not have to move the bed, which is fast.
there is delta, which i dont know much about, but the bed there is a circle, not rectangle</p>
<h3 id="bambulab-p1s-with-ams">bambulab p1s with ams<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#bambulab-p1s-with-ams"></a></h3>
<p>1000ish , ams is the multicolor/material stuff, very usefu especially for support removal as discussed
bambulab was the big winner in the end of 2022, many companies are cloning their systems and trying to beat them on speed, like
enclosed, building volume 256^3. without the ams same price as the bellow ones.</p>
<p>very integrated ecosystem, which is nice to begin with but many downsides, mods are not as common...</p>
<h2 id="creality-k1c-or-qidi-3x-pro">Creality k1c or qidi 3x pro<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#creality-k1c-or-qidi-3x-pro"></a></h2>
<p>i think 600 or 700, a bit bigger and better specs, and more established companies, but no working multimaterial system yet.   </p>
<p>about hte ams, it adds a lot of convenience in general, as it can serve as dry box, it can help with the supports as mentioned, and it can also be used to just not swap rolls all the time...</p>
