<p>everyone can read and write at the same time</p>

<p>if you and I both read some data, it will be the same.</p>

<p>the system works well across physical network partitions.</p>
<p>Examples with a physical notebook- we all write some data for family finances in a  notebook.
I have a notebook now and I put it on the camina. Now, a database system would be:
Who's allowed to write in nb . What are the allowed to write?
What constraints, like you can't write that I have 100000 usd;
What happens if 2 peoiple try to write simultaneously?</p>
<p>Cap theorem- pick 2</p>

<p> In case of Partitionin one has to choose between availability and consistency,
else (normal operations) between latency and consistency (in the sense of data consistency).</p>
