<p>The conclusion from the book is that limited screen time is not likely to be a problem.
This is true if TV is replacing low-value activities. When the parent/caregiver is tired or needs to do something  they can use the TV.
Children below the age of 3 years are not likely to learn anything from TV. Older children (3-5) can get value from educational material, such as Sesame Street. Interaction w/ real humans is still a  higher value learning activity.</p>
<p>It's likely that educational screen time (i.e. various games on the iPad) have similar properties, e.g. for very small children useless, but after 18-24 months, maybe useful.</p>
<p>Watch out for reduced physical activity, as obesity is a risk w/ TV.</p>

<p>Summary:
AAP recommendation from Emily Oster's childhood, as well as today:</p>
<p>Main arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Children and teens should have no more than <strong>one to two hours</strong> of screen time per day,
with children under <strong>2 having no screen time at all</strong>. Those orders remain the same today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But, iPad, Kindle, and others have opened the world of <strong>educational</strong> screen time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mainly focusing on TV (passive) vs doing stuff on computer, or educational games.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many studies, looking at executive function, but many confounders (TV time not randomly assigned - parents with less money, education give more passive screen time).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you control for this results are mixedtest scores not so much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some evidence that reducing screen time can combat <strong>obesity</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eye strain not an issue- <strong>kindle is fine</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some researchers used differen time TV was introduced in different parts of USA to produce counterfactuals for analysis:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Direct Quote:
"The impacts of TV on IQ and test scores have not been subjected to large
randomized trial evaluation. Perhaps the best causal evidence on this question
comes from a 2008 paper by two media economists.1 The researchers take advantage
of the fact that television was introduced to different areas of the United States at
different times. This variation meant that, when television was first introduced in the
1940s and 1950s, some kids had access to TV when they were children and
some did not. The researchers could then see how having TV access as a
young child — what the AAP is most worried about — related to test scores
when kids were in school at slightly older ages."</p>
<ul>
<li>maybe small impact on obesity, but difficult to study</li>
<li>What do you do instead of TV/ gaming. if whining and doing nothing, not so good. If interacting around, better.</li>
</ul>

<p>Direct quote:
"With this insight, it’s easy to see why less television is likely to decrease obesity. The process of weight gain and loss is pretty simple: if you burn more calories than you take in, you’ll lose weight. Watching television is mostly done sitting. And most other activities involve at least some moving around. So pretty much no matter what else they do, watching less TV is likely to be associated with kids burning more calories and losing weight."</p>
