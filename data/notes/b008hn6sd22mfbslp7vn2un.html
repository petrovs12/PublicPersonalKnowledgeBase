<p>Firmware is software that's embedded in a piece of hardware. Think <strong>software for hardware</strong>.</p>
<p>From (wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware].</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p> BIOS of a computer: defines basic functions of a device, providing hardware abstraction services to higher level software such as OS.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia again:</p>
<p>Hardware abstractions are sets of routines in software that provide programs with access to hardware resources through programming interfaces. The programming interface allows all devices in a particular class C of hardware devices to be accessed through identical interfaces even though C may contain different subclasses of devices that each provide a different hardware interface.</p>
