# how to learn more from audiobooks and podcasts
1. Before listening, write down what you already know about the topic (priming, get into the mood).
2. split into chunks if quite long.
3. do free recall, fill gaps (by maybe listening again), write down open questions.
4. listen to the next chunk
. after listening to the whole thing, do free recall again.
6. try to find something to listen to from a different perscpective, maybe a different source.

example - history of vikings, after that maybe listen to something about france in that age, something about england, then you get a comprehensve picture and make the 'relational diagram' hairier/denser.
