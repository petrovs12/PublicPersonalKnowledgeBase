<li>We consider the problem of how to implement eÂ¢ cient allocations in
an environment where each participant has private information about
their preferences. Participants may misrepresent their preferences.</li>
<li>A bank may overstate its need for a federal bailout, hoping to get
taxpayers to absorb its losses.</li>
<li>A buyer might understate its value, hoping to get a lower price.

allocations in quasi-linear environments, but can have trouble with
budget balance.</li>
