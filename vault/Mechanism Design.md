The Stanley Reiter diagram above illustrates a game of mechanism design. The upper-left space {\displaystyle \Theta }\Theta  depicts the type space and the upper-right space X the space of outcomes. The social choice function {\displaystyle f(\theta )}f(\theta ) maps a type profile to an outcome. In games of mechanism design, agents send messages {\displaystyle M}M in a game environment {\displaystyle g}g. The equilibrium in the game {\displaystyle \xi (M,g,\theta )}\xi (M,g,\theta ) can be designed to implement some social choice function {\displaystyle f(\theta )}f(\theta ).
