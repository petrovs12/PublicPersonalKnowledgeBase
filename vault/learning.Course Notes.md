[How to ask good questions](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)

* Show your work
* minimally reproducible example (of what didn't work)
* Show what didn't work, journey trough 
* Many ways to be wrong.
* So narrow down the problem as much as you can so people can help you


Cause there are many ways for something not to work, try stuff out...

## This course is not a spectator sport


[Mathematics is not a Spectator sport](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/mathematics-is-not-a-spectator-sport)
You have to cosntantly practice it...

Have to practice.



## Skill Acquisition is more complicated than just theory, practice is important too


## Claiming they are ahead of research




#TODO Why research trickles down slowly into practice

Common sharlatan claim?

Specific claims about learning- learner focused, rather than policy-focused.
 
 Research is policy focused (focused on what teachers should do...)

 Very doubious claims on this...


### Research practice gap

[ACM article](https://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/july-august-2010/the-research-practice-gap1)
#TODO check if this is real or not...s

The picture has soem problems:
1. What if the problem can be identified from first principles and on small scale studies?
## Deviation from the couRse
They claim it's super optimized and gaps will appear and bottleneck you later.

### Selective learning
### Lack of practice (spectator sport)
### Rushing



## Encoding vs PKM

The course focuses on learning how to learn and encode/understand things better, rahter than  \\



## Funcamentals vs Growth Stages

First it'sthe high yield stage, where we reap rewards from the fundamentals...

### How do you know you've mastered a technique?

Be able to apply it and feel it's kind of working. E.g. not looking at notes way too much...

70-80% only checking notes sometimes.

A bit more consolidations/practice.

Almost second nature to it.

[[Health And Personal Development.Unconcious Competence]]


 I **Higher Ground Series** is about modifying fundamentals for special contexts, like professional or ADHD, etc.


## The learning is path, dependent...

![](/assets/images/2022-08-06-12-13-53.png)
so small perturbations/errors propagate...
**So they don't recommend deviating from the course at all, cause they think it's optimized and the path dependency is strong.**


## How to take notes, when to take the notes, etc...s


### Peer feedback on Discord is nice already

### Office hours- group call - doctor consultation. Basically 1-on-1 with the instructor.

### Spot the issues
Library of worked examples

### Live clinics

2 hour group call..


## With the fundamentals- experiment

If you feel confused whenapplying some of the techniques.

Misinterpreted Effort Hypothesis

Failure is Success...


Try many things...
