Notes from 2nd chapter of __The Product Book__.

# What product are we building?


# Why does the company exist?

[Start with Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4&ab_channel=TED)
There's a book as well.

## _Why_ is guiding light

If the product is told as a story, __why__ is the theme. 

What is the story about?

__Mission Statement__

__why->how->what__

Start with raison d'etre, then figure out how it would be achieved, and finally __what__ to build.

#NB The order of __how__ and __what__ in this context is different than when thinking aobut requirements and implementation details.

### Apple examples:
* If starting with 'what :“We make great computers. They’re user-friendly, beautifully designed, and
easy to use. Want to buy one?” That’s fine, but it sounds pretty generic.
Many other PC manufacturers even make the same claim!
* if starting with 'why': “With
everything we do, we aim to challenge the status quo. We aim to think
differently. Our products are user-friendly, beautifully designed, and easy
to use. We just happen to make great computers. Want to buy one?
