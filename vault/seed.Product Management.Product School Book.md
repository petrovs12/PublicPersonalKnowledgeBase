# Product Manager Role

**Understand what game the company is playing and how to keep score**




Nobody Asked you to show up!

Engineers build, designers design, marketers make sure people know about it, sales sales, product managers do what?


## Justify your existence.




PM Parts:
1. Idenitfy opportunities- hypothesise
2.  Design Iteration


1. Identity right opportunity.
2. Build it
3. Be a **Mini CEO**
4. Feature subsetting: Once the goal is clear, everybody has many ideas. Your part is to decide which one to keep.
5. Trade-off technical debt for pushing things forward. 
6. Pay the technical debt so project doesn't become stuck in inability to execute further.


## Key skills

Technical, communication, industry expertise.

Triangle of

Engineering, Product Management, Design, Marketing.

### How technical? 
Somewhat - know how not to be lied to and how to not lie to themselves vis-a-vis technical topics.

### How business-oriented? 

Know industry; how businesses make money? What are key players, competitors? What differentiates our company to theirs.

## Types

Production Product Manager- internal, focusing on having things build

Marketing PM- more external, focused on making sure ppl know about product.









### Customer Representative

Customers dont' want to give you money. Customers want to be awesome. You help them be awesome.

#### Company can operate and scale to a point without PM's



# How do PM's get products built?

## Planning Cadence

### Waterfall
lots of planning

### Agile
fast iteration, MVP's

### Hybrid (recommended)

Medium planning beforehand to identify opportunity, then fast iteration w/ MVP's

## Product Development Lifecycle

1. Finding and Planning the Right Opportunity
2. Designing the Solution
3. Building the Solution
4. Sharing the Solution
5. Assessing the Solution [[seed.Product Management.Product Metrics]]


### Planning and Opportunity hypothesis

#### **What is the right thing to work on next?**

The core part of the job.
Broken down to:

* [[seed.Product Management.Strategic Understanding of The Company]]
 1. Team Capabilities
 2. User Needs - be focused
 
* Create [[seed.Product Management.Opportunity#^create]]
* Validate [[seed.Product Management.Opportunity#^validate]]

How to get ideas?

Look at [[seed.Product Management.Product Metrics]] on how users are using the product. What are they engaging with?
Does this contradict with data from surveys?

For example, it might be that in a CNN app users engage more with videos that text articles. Maybe they watch the whole video,
but dont' scroll down as much. This is an __opportunity__ to make them engage more with the content (and show more ads).




### [[seed.Product Management.Product Metrics]]


Select proper metrics.

Consider Company goals, culture, capabilities to filter opportunities.
Ask yourself 'Why does the company exist??'


After identifying the right opportunity, you need to [[seed.Product Management.Opportunity#^validate]] validate it.

After validating, need to turn it into something build-able.

#### Scoping and [[seed.Product Management.Minimum Viable Product]]

Define goals and non-goals.
Clearly define the opportunity, customers you want to target (and don't want to target), and product requirements .


Example:

Opportunity:
Build a Pen
Customers:
Students

Non-goals
I don't need it to work in space or underwater? But it's good if it works upside-down?








###  








 


#### Designing

Wireframes, user research [[seed.Product Management.Personas]].
Survery, user testing. 
Wireframes are clickable, w/ fake data.
Investigate layout and information ordering.

### Building

Taking on technical debt- must manage that, considering current needs (i.e. build this now) vs future development
cadence and flexibility.
