[ASAP: Automatic Smoothing for Attention Prioritization in Streaming Time Series Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00983v1)

# Situation
Much telemetry data has been generated from various systems. For some of it there are human operators,
looking at it in order to do detect anomalies quickly.

But trend shifts can be hidden by variance.

Idea:

Smooth variance between first differences
subject to kurtosis (4th moment) remaining the same.
