Ways to read a paper first pass

Video by sung- build skeleton first;
etc.
So go quickly trough the table of contents and try to gleam what the topic is and what are it's subtopics.

Useful for math ? Maybe not

**Main headings, start, end of paragraph, figures.**

How many concepts, what are the concepts, how dense.


Read ToC first.


**Try to ask deep questions as you go, even if you don't know the wods. Try to guess possible answers/ideas.**
