 (First,note that I haven't found a deterministic solution for the problem with "stages buffering", but trying to think of the ways to stochastically analyze the whole thing and how to get the optimum utility of time spend in jail/risk). The note is not very well structured ,if you have some questions (though it's completely useless problem, of course)  please call me.
 So, we assume that we can calculate the interarrival time, but we need a
So, the problem is:
 We are in a prison, and there is this warden ,who gives us the following game: We are prisoners;before the game starts, we can talk to each other, after it starts we can't talk any more.
 At random times ,the warden calls a random prisoner in a room with a light switch, which is initially off;.
 If at any point any of the prisoners announces that all the prisoners have visited the room, then all are free if he(she ?) 's correct.
