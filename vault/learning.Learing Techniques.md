Cognitive change/transformation.

Timestamps for when he speaks:

* 00:30 - Have your study stuff with you

 **Optimize Environment, make it you don't get up. All resources in front.**
 Foods for study- almonds/fruit (no sugar crash).
 Lon-linear notes [[learning.Mindmaps#^nonlinear]]
* 02:13 - Preparing is a legit step + apps he uses for notetaking
!![[learning.Notetaking apps#^hnd]]
* 05:13 - Recommended snacks + explanation on notetaking

Most of study happens inside the head.
Spend as little time of notetaking as possible.
Once done the learning, document that.

**Thinking a lot, playing with ideas**, less time spent on notetaking (?).

Always handwritten, always non-written if possible (?).




* 06:23 - More explanation on notetaking and learning
* 07:52 - Handwritten notes vs typed notes
* 09:41 - Priming Step
[[learning.Priming]]
* 12:10 - Sensory Distraction or Sensory Deprivation 
Keep your focus on reading, maybe rythim. Play pen/etc. 

* 13:25 - What he is reading atm for priming
When you read a sentence during priming, even if you don't know the words, play with it, think what it could mean,etc.
* 14:03 - Learning in your head is slow
* 16:52 - Finished reading contents + how to avoid passive reading + concentration tip + explanation on what he's thinking
**Be clear on why you're reading something. Both in terms of the inidial goal, and where he's at at a given timepoint**.
* 19:10 - Explanation on reading the preface (speed reading)
**Preface is skimmed.** Skim trough about what that's talking about... It's okay to skip if you don't need to learn it ...
* 21:21 - Quick note on the mental model
Mental model - no words, but images. Turn words into images. Re-express it as a mental image... Image is easier to hold than 10 different words across a flowchart.
* 22:53 - How he developed this method
**1000s of hours of reading research, 10000s of hours of self-experimentation**.

* 23:34 - Drawing out what he is imagining
So the point is just to try to right away connect stuff, enrich the image and as you go correct it if needed.
* 25:30 - Embracing the confusion

**Go back and forth with things.**
[[Health And Personal Development.Progressive Overload]]


Try to keep as many things in your mind as long as comfortable, then keep in mind a bit longer [[Health And Personal Development.Progressive Overload]].
* 28:37 - Page 1 + Priming + If I don't remember something, how do I overcome it
So it's quite different than the second brain stuff in many ways...
* 31:21 - Priming through the pages
he thinks that his initial framework was accurate. Having a visual aid might be good.
* 33:57 - Finished priming

* 35:04 - Do you listen to study music?
maybe/probably not...
* 35:55 - Going through from the beginning being curious and inquisitive (why am I reading this, for what purpose, how can I apply it and how can I simplify it) - Blooms Taxonomy
* 37:42 - Are you reading backwards?
* 38:40 - A relaxing process; a well-oiled habit
* 41:00 - How can I apply it?
* 42:40 - Loosing any detail when skimming
* 46:06 - Annotating while reading - is it valid?
* 47:32 - Is this the only study technique that you use?
* 49:24 - Bullet Points - Memorizing specifics
* 53:01 - Change on his mental model (Hypercorrection effect)
* 54:11 - Read his mind + course ad + guarantee
* 59:04 - Threshhold concept breached - "Lightbulb moment"
* 1:04:05 - The best time to take breaks
* 1:05:29 - He's confused - Apply+Simplify
* 1:06:09 - Trying to make an analogy to simplify
* 1:10:44 - Creating focus
* 1:15:15 - Remembers another framework thus speeding up the process of learning
* 1:16:53 - Skips to another part of the book to learn more about a topic
* 1:18:16 - Back to where he was
* 1:23:48 - Study sessions vary
* 1:26:42 - Exponential increase + special information + good book
* 1:30:35 - Hour and a half of stream (40min study - page 33)
* 1:31:04 - Notes after priming? prioritize learning istead of note taking + showing mindmap
* 1:35:40 - Reading details and it makes sense because he knows the logic behind all of it
* 1:38:55 - Satisfaction of learning
* 1:44:54 - Quick technique - analogy and representing on the mindmap
* 1:46:42 - Are there any more websites to find out more about learning? + thoughts on study tips and non scientifical sources
* 1:49:13 - Thomas Frank
1:53:41 - 50 pages + What do you mean by studying fast? + What is a successful study session? + ending



# Write Down Challenging Questions for yourself to Answer 

In a bit of time, either as a prompt or work towards it. Either way, it's a problem solving thing.


# Learn on hour, spend 5 minutes writing notes

Sounds difficult...

relies on you being able to remember quite a bit...
