Algorithmic Game Theory is sitting in the intersection of economics and computer science. 

One way to look at it is as follows:

Economics is conserned with equilibria of market-like structures. These equilibria could 
have various 'utilities' (in the sense of wellfare). 

## Complexity theory view
'If your computer can't find the equilibria, neither can the market'. 
Or the good equilibria, etc.
